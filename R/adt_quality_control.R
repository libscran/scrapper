#' Quality control for ADT count data
#'
#' Compute per-cell QC metrics from an initialized matrix of ADT counts,
#' and use the metrics to suggest filter thresholds to retain high-quality cells.
#' 
#' @param x A matrix-like object where rows are ADTs and columns are cells.
#' Values are expected to be counts.
#' @param subsets List of vectors specifying tag subsets of interest, typically control tags like IgGs.
#' Each vector may be logical (whether to keep each row), integer (row indices) or character (row names).
#' @param num.threads Integer scalar specifying the number of threads to use.
#' @param metrics List with the same structure as produced by \code{computeAdtQcMetrics}.
#' @param block Factor specifying the block of origin (e.g., batch, sample) for each cell in \code{metrics}.
#' Alternatively \code{NULL} if all cells are from the same block.
#'
#' For \code{filterAdtQcMetrics}, a blocking factor should be provided if \code{block} was used to construct \code{thresholds}. 
#' @param min.detected.drop Minimum drop in the number of detected features from the median, in order to consider a cell to be of low quality.
#' @param num.mads Number of median from the median, to define the threshold for outliers in each metric.
#' @param thresholds List with the same structure as produced by \code{suggestAdtQcThresholds}.
#'
#' @return For \code{computeAdtQcMetrics}, a list is returned containing:
#' \itemize{
#' \item \code{sum}, a numeric vector containing the total ADT count for each cell.
#' In theory, this represents the efficiency of library preparation and sequencing.
#' Compared to RNA, the sum is less useful as a QC metric for ADT data as it is strongly influenced by biological variation in the abundance of the targeted features.
#' Nonetheless, we compute it for diagnostic purposes.
#' \item \code{detected}, an integer vector containing the number of detected tags per cell.
#' Even though ADTs are typically used in situations where few features are highly abundant (e.g., cell type-specific markers), 
#' we still expect detectable coverage of most features due to ambient contamination, non-specific binding or some background expression.
#' Low numbers of detected tags indicates that library preparation or sequencing depth was suboptimal.
#' \item \code{subsets}, a list of numeric vectors containing the total count of each control subset. 
#' The exact interpretation depends on the nature of the feature subset but the most common use case involves isotype control (IgG) features.
#' IgG antibodies should not bind to anything so a high subset sum suggests that non-specific binding is a problem, e.g., due to antibody conjugates.
#' (Unlike RNA quality control, we do not use proportions here as it is entirely possible for a cell to have low counts for other tags due to the absence of their targeted features;
#' this would result in a high proportion even if the cell has a "normal" level of non-specific binding.)
#' }
#' Each vector is of length equal to the number of cells.
#'
#' For \code{suggestAdtQcThresholds}, a named list is returned:
#' \itemize{
#' \item If \code{block=NULL}, the list contains:
#' \itemize{
#' \item \code{detected}, a numeric scalar containing the lower bound on the number of detected tags. 
#' This is defined as the lower of (i) \code{num.mads} MADs below the median for the log-transformed values across all cells,
#' and (ii) the product of \code{1 - min.detected.drop} and the median across all cells.
#' The latter avoids overly aggressive filtering when the MAD is zero.
#' \item \code{subsets}, a numeric vector containing the upper bound on the sum of counts in each control subset. 
#' This is defined as \code{num.mads} MADs above the median of the log-transformed metrics across all cells.
#' }
#' \item Otherwise, if \code{block} is supplied, the list contains:
#' \itemize{
#' \item \code{detected}, a numeric vector containing the lower bound on the number of detected tags for each blocking level.
#' Here, the threshold is computed independently for each block, using the same method as the unblocked case.
#' \item \code{subsets}, a list of numeric vectors containing the upper bound on the sum of counts in each control subset for each blocking level.
#' Here, the threshold is computed independently for each block, using the same method as the unblocked case.
#' }
#' Each vector is of length equal to the number of levels in \code{block} and is named accordingly.
#' }
#'
#' For \code{filterAdtQcMetrics}, a logical vector of length \code{ncol(x)} is returned indicating which cells are of high quality. 
#' High-quality cells are defined as those with numbers of detected tags above the \code{detected} threshold and control subset sums below the \code{subsets} threshold.
