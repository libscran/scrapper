\title{Choose a suitable pseudo-count}
\usage{
choosePseudoCount(size.factors, quantile = 0.05, max.bias = 1, min.value = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{size.factors}{Numeric vector of size factors for all cells.
It is expected that these have already been centered, e.g., with \code{\link{centerSizeFactors}}.
Invalid size factors (e.g., non-positive, non-finite) will be ignored.}

\item{quantile}{Numeric scalar specifying the quantile to use for finding the smallest/largest size factors.
Setting this to zero will use the observed minimum and maximum, though in practice, this is usually too sensitive to outliers.
The default is to take the 5th and 95th percentile to obtain a range that captures most of the distribution.}

\item{max.bias}{Numeric scalar specifying the maximum allowed bias.
This is the maximum absolute value of any spurious log2-fold change between the cells with the smallest and largest size factors.}

\item{min.value}{Numeric scalar specifying the minimum value for the pseudo-count.
Defaults to 1 to stabilize near-zero normalized expression values, otherwise these manifest as avoid large negative values.}
}
\value{
A choice of pseudo-count for \code{\link{normalizeCounts}}.
}
\description{
Choose a suitable pseudo-count to control the bias introduced by log-transformation of normalized counts from \code{\link{normalizeCounts}}.
Larger pseudo-counts shrink log-expression values towards the zero-expression baseline,
reducing the impact of the transformation bias at the cost of some sensitivity.
}
\examples{
sf <- centerSizeFactors(runif(100))
choosePseudoCount(sf)
choosePseudoCount(sf, quantile=0.01)
choosePseudoCount(sf, max.bias=0.5)
