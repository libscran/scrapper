\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix-like object where rows correspond to genes or genomic features and columns correspond to cells.
It is typically expected to contain log-expression values, e.g., from \code{\link{normalizeCounts}}.}

\item{groups}{A vector specifying the group assignment for each cell in \code{x}.}

\item{block}{Factor specifying the block of origin (e.g., batch, sample) for each cell in \code{x}.
If provided, comparisons are performed within each block to ensure that block effects do not confound the estimates.
The weighted average of the effect sizes across all blocks is reported for each gene.
Alternatively \code{NULL}, if all cells are from the same block.}

\item{block.weight.policy}{String specifying the policy to use for weighting different blocks when computing the average for each statistic.
See the argument of the same name in \code{\link{computeBlockWeights}} for more detail.
Only used if \code{block} is not \code{NULL}.}

\item{variable.block.weight}{Numeric vector of length 2, specifying the parameters for variable block weighting.
See the argument of the same name in \code{\link{computeBlockWeights}} for more detail.
Only used if \code{block} is not \code{NULL} and \code{block.weight.policy = "variable"}.}

\description{
Score marker genes for each group using a variety of effect sizes from pairwise comparisons between groups.
This includes Cohen's d, the area under the curve (AUC), the difference in the means (delta-mean) and the difference in the proportion of detected cells (delta-detected).
For each group, the strongest markers are those genes with the largest effect sizes (i.e., upregulated) when compared to all other groups.
}
\section{Choice of effect size}{

The delta-mean is the difference in the mean expression between groups.
This is fairly straightforward to interpret - a positive delta-mean corresponds to increased expression in the first group compared to the second. 
The delta-mean can also be treated as the log-fold change if the input matrix contains log-transformed normalized expression values.

The delta-detected is the difference in the proportion of cells with detected expression between groups.
This lies between 1 and -1, with the extremes occurring when a gene is silent in one group and detected in all cells of the other group.
For this interpretation, we assume that the input matrix contains non-negative expression values, where a value of zero corresponds to lack of detectable expression.

Cohen's d is the standardized difference between two groups.
This is defined as the difference in the mean for each group scaled by the average standard deviation across the two groups.
(Technically, we should use the pooled variance; however, this introduces some unintuitive asymmetry depending on the variance of the larger group, so we take a simple average instead.)
A positive value indicates that the gene has increased expression in the first group compared to the second.
Cohen's d is analogous to the t-statistic in a two-sample t-test and avoids spuriously large effect sizes from comparisons between highly variable groups.
We can also interpret Cohen's d as the number of standard deviations between the two group means.

The area under the curve (AUC) is the probability that a randomly chosen observation in one group is greater than a randomly chosen observation in the other group. 
Values greater than 0.5 indicate that a gene is upregulated in the first group.
The AUC is closely related to the U-statistic used in the Wilcoxon rank sum test. 
The key difference between the AUC and Cohen's d is that the former is less sensitive to the variance within each group, e.g.,
if two distributions exhibit no overlap, the AUC is the same regardless of the variance of each distribution. 
This may or may not be desirable as it improves robustness to outliers but reduces the information available to obtain a fine-grained ranking.
}

\section{With a minimum change threshold}{

Setting a minimum change threshold (i.e., \code{threshold}) prioritizes genes with large shifts in expression instead of those with low variances.
Currently, only positive thresholds are supported, which focuses on genes that are upregulated in the first group compared to the second.
The effect size definitions are generalized when testing against a non-zero threshold:
\itemize{
\item Cohen's d is redefined as the standardized difference between the difference in means and the specified threshold,
analogous to the TREAT method from the \pkg{limma} package.
Large positive values are only obtained when the observed difference in means is significantly greater than the threshold.
For example, if we had a threshold of 2 and we obtained a Cohen's d of 3, this means that the observed difference in means was 3 standard deviations greater than 2.
Note that a negative Cohen's d cannot be intepreted as downregulation, as the difference in means may still be positive but less than the threshold.
\item The AUC is generalized to the probability of obtaining a random observation in one group that is greater than a random observation plus the threshold in the other group.
For example, if we had a threshold of 2 and we obtained an AUC of 0.8, this means that, 80% of the time,
the random observation from the first group would be greater than a random observation from the second group by 2 or more.
Again, AUCs below 0.5 cannot be interpreted as downregulation, as it may be caused by a positive shift that is less than the threshold.
