Title: Bindings to C++ Code for Single-Cell Analysis
Description: 
    Implements bindings to C++ code for analyzing single-cell (expression) data, mostly from the libscran library. 
    This provides low-level utilities for individual analysis steps from quality control to clustering and marker detection.
    It is intended for other package developers, with only limited support for a user-friendly end-to-end workflow.
